This repository contains two class templates: `indirect` and `polymorphic`. Both
templates are designed to be used for member data in composite types.

* An instance of `indirect<T>` owns an object of class `T`.

* An instance of `polymorphic<T>` owns an object of class `T` or a class derived
from `T`.

Both classes behave as value types and allow special member functions for a
class that contains them as members to be generated correctly. Our experience
suggests that use of these class templates can significantly decrease the burden
of writing and maintaining error-prone boilerplate code.

## Standardization

We'd like to see `indirect` and `polymorphic` included in a future version of
the C++ standard. Prior work on standardizing similar types, `indirect_value`
and `polymorphic_value` can be found at

* [A polymorphic value-type for
  C++](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2019/p0201r5.html)

* [indirect_value: A Free-Store-Allocated Value Type For
  C++](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p1950r2.html)

Design of these two types is so deeply coupled that future work will proceed in
[an updated paper](DRAFT.md).

## Use
The `indirect` and `polymorphic` class templates are header-only. To use them,
include the headers `indirect.h` and `polymorphic.h` in your project.

```cpp
#include "indirect.h"

class Composite {
  xyz::indirect<A> a_; // a_ owns an object of type A
  xyz::indirect<B> b_; // b_ owns an object of type B
public:
  Composite(const A& a, const B& b) :
    a_(a),
    b_(b) {}

  // ...
};
```

```cpp
#include "polymorphic.h"

class CompositeWithPolymorphicMembers {
  xyz::polymorphic<X> x_; // x_ owns an object of type X or derived from X
  xyz::polymorphic<Y> y_; // y_ owns an object of type Y or derived from Y
public:
  template <typename Tx, typename Ty>
  Composite(const Tx& x, const Ty& y) :
    a_(std::in_place_type<Tx>, x),
    b_(std::in_place_type<Ty>, y) {}

    // ...
};
```

### Compiler explorer

You can try out `indirect` and `polymorphic` in [Compiler explorer](https://godbolt.org/)
by adding the includes:

```cpp
#include <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbcoe/value_types/main/indirect.h>
#include <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbcoe/value_types/main/polymorphic.h>
```

### Compatibility

We have C++14 implementations of `indirect` and `polymorphic` available as
`indirect_cxx14.h` and `polymorphic_cxx14.h`.

C++14 implementations can be tried out in compiler explorer by using the includes:

```cpp
#include <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbcoe/value_types/main/indirect_cxx14.h>
#include <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbcoe/value_types/main/polymorphic_cxx14.h>
```

## Talks and presentations

We spoke about an earlier draft at [C++ on
Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjLRX4WMvlU) in 2022.

There are some significant design changes since this talk was given (after feedback
and discussion at a C++ London meetup). We've pared down the number of constructors
and made the null state unobservable.

## Developer Guide

For building and working with the project, please see the [developer guide](DEVELOPMENT.md).
