## Abstract

We propose the addition of two new class templates to the C++ Standard Library:
`indirect<T>` and `polymorphic<T>`.

Specializations of these class templates have value semantics and compose well
with other standard library types (such as vector), allowing the compiler to
correctly generate special member functions.

The class template `indirect` confers value-like semantics on a
free-store-allocated object. An `indirect` may hold an object of a class `T`.
Copying the `indirect` will copy the object `T`. When an `indirect<T>` is
accessed through a const access path, constness will propagate to the owned
object.

The class template `polymorphic` confers value-like semantics on a
dynamically-allocated object.  A `polymorphic<T>` may hold an object of a class
publicly derived from `T`. Copying the `polymorphic<T>` will copy the object of
the derived type. When a `polymorphic<T>` is accessed through a const access
path, constness will propagate to the owned object.

This proposal is a fusion of two earlier individual proposals, P1950 and P0201.
The design of the two proposed class templates is sufficiently similar that they
should not be considered in isolation.

## History

### Changes in R8

* Add more explicit wording for use of `allocator_traits::construct` in
  `indirect` and `polymorphic` constructors.

* Prevent `indirect` and `polymorphic` classes from being instantiated with
  `in_place_t` and specializations of `in_place_type_t`.

* Strike mandates `T` is a complete type from indirect comparison operators and
  hash for consistency with reference wrapper.

### Changes in R7

* Discuss `indirect`'s non-conditional copy constructor in the light of
  implementation tricks that would enable it.

* Improve wording for assignment operators to remove ambiguity.

* Add motivation for `valueless_after_move` member function.

### Changes in R6

* Add `std::in_place_t` argument to indirect constructors.

* Amend wording for assignment operators to provide strong exception guarantee.

### Changes in R5

* Fix wording for assignment operators to provide strong exception guarantee.

  constructible. This ensures that `std::is_copy_constructible_v` does not give
  misleading results.

  returning `bool` and `auto`.

  constraints.

* Add constructor `polymorphic(allocator_arg_t, const Allocator& a)` overload.

* Add discussion on similarities and differences with variant.

* Add table of breaking and non-breaking changes to appendix C.

* Add missing comparison operators and ensure they are all conditionally
  noexcept.

* Add argument deduction guides for `std::indirect`.

* Address incorrect `std::indirect` usage in composite example.

* Additions to acknowledgements.

* Address wording for `swap()` relating to `noexcept`.

* Address constraints wording for `std::indirect` comparison operators.

* Add `std::format` support for `std::indirect`

* Add Appendix B before and after examples.

* Add preconditions checking for types are not valueless.

* Add constexpr support.

* Allow quality of implementation support for small buffer optimization for
  `polymorphic`.

* Extend wording for allocator support.

* Change _constraints_ to _mandates_ to enable support for incomplete types.

* Change pointer usage to use `allocator_traits` pointer.

* Remove `std::inplace_t` parameter in constructors for `std::indirect`.

* Fix `sizeof` error.

## Motivation

The standard library has no vocabulary type for a dynamically-allocated object
with value semantics. When designing a composite class, we may need an object to
be stored indirectly to support incomplete types, reduce object size or support
open-set polymorphism.

We propose the addition of two new class templates to the standard library to
represent indirectly stored values: `indirect` and `polymorphic`. Both class
templates represent dynamically-allocated objects with value-like semantics.
`polymorphic<T>` can own any object of a type publicly derived from `T`,
allowing composite classes to contain polymorphic components. We require the
addition of two classes to avoid the cost of virtual dispatch (calling the copy
constructor of a potentially derived-type object through type erasure) when
copying of polymorphic objects is not needed.

## Design requirements

We review the fundamental design requirements of `indirect` and `polymorphic`
that make them suitable for composite class design.

### Special member functions

Both class templates are suitable for use as members of composite classes where
the compiler will generate special member functions. This means that the class
templates should provide the special member functions where they are supported
by the owned object type `T`.

* `indirect<T, Alloc>` and `polymorphic<T, Alloc>` are default constructible in
  cases where `T` is default constructible.

* `indirect<T, Alloc>` and `polymorphic<T, Alloc>` are unconditionally copy
  constructible and assignable, move constructible and move assignable.

* `indirect<T, Alloc>` and `polymorphic<T, Alloc>` destroy the owned object in
  their destructors.

### Deep copies

Copies of `indirect<T>` and `polymorphic<T>` should own copies of the owned
object created with the copy constructor of the owned object. In the case of
`polymorphic<T>`, this means that the copy should own a copy of a potentially
derived type object created with the copy constructor of the derived type
object.

Note: Including a `polymorphic` component in a composite class means that
virtual dispatch will be used (through type erasure) in copying the
`polymorphic` member. Where a composite class contains a polymorphic member from
a known set of types, prefer `std::variant` or `indirect<std::variant>` if
indirect storage is required.

### `const` propagation

When composite objects contain `pointer`, `unique_ptr` or `shared_ptr` members
they allow non-const access to their respective pointees when accessed through a
const access path. This prevents the compiler from eliminating a source of
const-correctness bugs and makes it difficult to reason about the
const-correctness of a composite object.

Accessors of unique and shared pointers do not have const and non-const
overloads:

```c++
T* unique_ptr<T>::operator->() const;
T& unique_ptr<T>::operator*() const;

T* shared_ptr<T>::operator->() const;
T& shared_ptr<T>::operator*() const;
```

When a parent object contains a member of type `indirect<T>` or
`polymorphic<T>`, access to the owned object (of type `T`) through a const
access path should be `const` qualified.

```c++
struct A {
    enum class Constness { CONST, NON_CONST };
    Constness foo() { return Constness::NON_CONST; }
    Constness foo() const { return Constness::CONST; };
};

class Composite {
    indirect<A> a_;

    Constness foo() { return a_->foo(); }
    Constness foo() const { return a_->foo(); };
};

int main() {
    Composite c;
    assert(c.foo() == A::Constness::NON_CONST);
    const Composite& cc = c;
    assert(cc.foo() == A::Constness::CONST);
}
```

### Value semantics

Both `indirect` and `polymorphic` are value types whose owned object is
dynamically-allocated (or some other memory resource controlled by the specified
allocator).

When a value type is copied it gives rise to two independent objects that can be
modified separately.

The owned object is part of the logical state of `indirect` and `polymorphic`.
Operations on a const-qualified object do not make changes to the object's
logical state nor to the logical state of other objects.

`indirect<T>` and `polymorphic<T>` are default constructible in cases where `T`
is default constructible. Moving a value type into dynamically allocated storage
should not add or remove the ability to be default constructed.

### The valueless state and interaction with `std::optional`

Both `indirect` and `polymorphic` have a valueless state that is used to
implement move. The valueless state is not intended to be observable to the
user. There is no `operator bool` or `has_value` member function. Accessing the
value of an `indirect` or `polymorphic` after it has been moved from is
undefined behaviour. We provide a `valueless_after_move` member function that
returns `true` if an object is in a valueless state. This allows explicit checks
for the valueless state in cases where it cannot be verified statically.

Without a valueless state, moving `indirect` or `polymorphic` would require
allocation and moving from the owned object. This would be expensive and would
require the owned object to be moveable. The existence of a valueless state
allows move to be implemented cheaply without requiring the owned object to be
moveable.

Where a nullable `indirect` or `polymorphic` is required, using `std::optional`
is recommended. This may become common practice since `indirect` and
`polymorphic` can replace smart pointers in composite classes, where they are
currently used to (mis)represent component objects. Putting `T` onto the free
store should not make it nullable. Nullability must be explicitly opted into by
using `std::optional<indirect<T>>` or `std::optional<polymorphic<T>>`.

### Allocator support

Both `indirect` and `polymorphic` are allocator-aware types. They must be
suitable for use in allocator-aware composite types and containers. Existing
allocator-aware types in the standard, such as `vector` and `map`, take an
allocator type as a template parameter, provide `allocator_type`, and have
constructor overloads taking an additional `allocator_type_t` and allocator
instance as arguments. As `indirect` and `polymorphic` need to work with and in
the same way as existing allocator-aware types, they too take an allocator type
as a template parameter, provide `allocator_type`, and have constructor
overloads taking an additional `allocator_type_t` and allocator instance as
arguments.

### Modelled types

The class templates `indirect` and `polymorphic` have strong similarities to
existing class templates. These similarities motivate much of the design; we aim
for consistency with existing library types, not innovation.

#### Modelled types for `indirect`

The class template `indirect` owns an object of known type, permits copies,
propagates const and is allocator aware.

* Like `optional` and `unique_ptr`, `indirect` can be in a valueless state;
  `indirect` can only get into the valueless state after being moved from, or
  assignment or construction from a valueless state.

* `unique_ptr` and `optional` have preconditions for `operator->` and
  `operator*`: the behavior is undefined if `*this` does not contain a value.

* `unique_ptr` and `optional` mark `operator->` and `operator*` as noexcept:
  `indirect` does the same.

* `optional` and `indirect` know the underlying type of the owned object so can
  implement r-value qualified versions of `operator*`. For `unique_ptr`, the
  underlying type is not known (it could be an instance of a derived class) so
  r-value qualified versions of `operator*` are not provided.

* Like `vector`, `indirect` owns an object created by an allocator. The move
  constructor and move assignment operator for `vector` are conditionally
  noexcept on properties of the allocator. Thus for `indirect`, the move
  constructor and move assignment operator are conditionally noexcept on
  properties of the allocator. (Allocator instances may have different
  underlying memory resources; it is not possible for an allocator with one
  memory resource to delete an object in another memory resource. When
  allocators have different underlying memory resources, move necessitates the
  allocation of memory and cannot be marked noexcept.) Like `vector`, `indirect`
  marks member and non-member `swap` as noexcept and requires allocators to be
  equal.

* Like `optional`, `indirect` knows the type of the owned object so forwards
  comparison operators and hash to the underlying object. A valueless
  `indirect`, like an empty `optional`, hashes to an implementation-defined
  value.

#### Modelled types for `polymorphic`

The class template `polymorphic` owns an object of known type, requires copies,
propagates const and is allocator aware.

* Like `optional` and `unique_ptr`, `polymorphic` can be in a valueless state;
  `polymorphic` can only get into the valueless state after being moved from, or
  assignment or construction from a valueless state.

* `unique_ptr` and `optional` have preconditions for `operator->` and
  `operator*`: the behavior is undefined if `*this` does not contain a value.

* `unique_ptr` and `optional` mark `operator->` and `operator*` as noexcept:
  `polymorphic` does the same.

* Neither `unique_ptr` nor `polymorphic` know the underlying type of the owned
  object so cannot implement r-value qualified versions of `operator*`. For
  `optional`, the underlying type is known, so r-value qualified versions of
  `operator*` are provided.

* Like `vector`, `polymorphic` owns an object created by an allocator. The move
  constructor and move assignment operator for `vector` are conditionally
  noexcept on properties of the allocator. Thus for `polymorphic`, the move
  constructor and move assignment operator are conditionally noexcept on
  properties of the allocator. Like `vector`, `polymorphic` marks member and
  non-member `swap` as noexcept and requires allocators to be equal.

* Like `unique_ptr`, `polymorphic` does not know the type of the owned object
  (it could be an instance of a derived type). As a result `polymorphic` cannot
  forward comparison operators or hash to the owned object.

#### Similarities and differences with variant

The sum type `variant<Ts...>` models one of several alternatives; `indirect<T>`
models a single type `T`, but with different storage constraints.

Like `indirect`, a variant can get into a valueless state. For variant, this
valueless state is accessible when an exception is thrown when changing the
type: variant has `bool valueless_by_exception()`. When all of the types `Ts`
are comparable, `variant<Ts...>` supports comparison without preconditions: it
is valid to compare variants when they are in a valueless state. Variant
comparisons can account for the valueless state with zero cost. A variant must
check which type is the engaged type to perform comparison; valueless is one of
the possible states it can be in. For `indirect`, allowing comparison when in a
valueless state necessitates the addition of an otherwise redundant check. After
feedback from standard library implementers, we opt to allow hash and comparison
of `indirect` in a valueless state, at cost, to avoid rendering the valueless
state user-hostile.

Variant allows valueless objects to be passed around via copy, assignment, move
and move assignment. There is no precondition on varaint that it must not be in
a valueless state to be copied from, moved from, assigned from or move assigned
from. While the notion that a valueless `indirect` or `polymorphic` is toxic and
must not be passed around code is appealing, it would not interact well with
generic code which may need to handle a variety of types. Note that the standard
does not require a moved-from object to be valid for copy, move, assign or move
assignment: the only restriction is that it should be in a well-formed but
unspecified state. However, there is no precedent for standard library types to
have preconditions on move, copy, assign or move assignment. We opt for
consistency with existing standard library types (namely varaint which has a
valueless state) and allow copy, move, assignment and move assignment of a
valueless `indirect` and `polymorphic`. Handling of the valueless state for
indirect and polymorphic in move operations will not incur cost; for copy
operations, the cost of handling the valueless state will be insignificant
compared to the cost of allocating memory. Introducing preconditions for copy,
move, assign and move assign in a later revision of the C++ standard would be a
silent breaking change.

Like `variant`, `indirect` does not support formatting by forwarding to the
owned object. There may be no owned object to format so we require the user to
write code to determine how to format a valueless `indirect` or to validate that
the `indirect` is not valueless before formatting `*i` (where `i` is an instance
of `indirect` for some formattable type `T`).

### `noexcept` and narrow contracts

C++ library design guidelines recommend that member functions with narrow
contracts (runtime preconditions) should not be marked `noexcept`. This is
partially motivated by a non-vendor implementation of the C++ standard library
that uses exceptions in a debug build to check for precondition violations by
throwing an exception. The `noexcept` status of `operator->` and `operator*` for
`indirect` and `polymorphic` is identical to that of `optional` and
`unique_ptr`. All have preconditions (`this` cannot be valueless), all are
marked `noexcept`. Whatever strategy was used for testing `optional` and
`unique_ptr` can be used for `indirect` and `polymorphic`.

Not marking `operator->` and `operator*` as `noexcept` for `indirect` and
`polymorphic` would make them strictly less useful than `unique_ptr` in contexts
where they would otherwise be a valid replacement.

### Tagged constructors

Constructors for `indirect` and `polymorphic` taking an allocator or owned
object constructor arguments are tagged with `allocator_arg_t` and `in_place_t`
(or `in_place_type_t`) respectively. This is consistent with the standard
library’s use of tagged constructors in `optional`, `any` and `variant`.

Without `in_place_t` the constructor of `indirect` would not be able to
construct an owned object using that owned object’s allocator-extended
constructor. `indirect(std::in_place, std::allocator_arg, alloc, args)`
unambiguously constructs an `indirect` with a default constructed allocator and
an owned object constructed with an allocator extended constructor taking an
allocator `alloc` and constructor arguments `args`.

### Explicit constructors

Constructors for `indirect` and `polymorphic` are marked as explicit. This
disallows “implicit conversion” from single arguments or braced initializers.
Given both `indirect` and `polymorphic` use dynamically-allocated storage, there
are no instances where an object could be considered semantically equivalent to
its constructor arguments (unlike `pair` or `variant`). To construct an
`indirect` or `polymorphic` object, and with it use dynamically allocate memory,
the user must explicitly use a constructor.

The standard already marks multiple argument constructors as explicit for the
inplace constructors of `optional` and `any`.

With some suitably compelling motivation, the `explicit` keyword could be
removed from some constructors in a later revision of the C++ standard without
rendering code ill-formed.

### The `valueless_after_move` member function

Both `indirect` and `polymorphic` have a `valueless_after_move` member function
that is used to query the object state. This member function should normally be
called: it should be clear through static analysis whether or not an object has
been moved from. The `valueless_after_move` member function allows explicit
checks for the valueless state in cases where it cannot be verified statically
or where explicit checks might be required by a coding standard such as MISRA or
High Integrity C++.

### Design for polymorphic types

A type `PolymorphicInterface` used as a base class with `polymorphic` does not
need a virtual destructor. The same mechanism that is used to call the copy
constructor of a potentially derived-type object will be used to call the
destructor.

To allow compiler-generation of special member functions of an abstract
interface type `PolymorphicInterface` in conjunction with `polymorphic`,
`PolymorphicInterface` needs at least a non-virtual protected destructor and a
protected copy constructor. `PolymorphicInterface` does not need to be
assignable, move constructible or move assignable for
`polymorphic<PolymorphicInterface>` to be assignable, move constructible or move
assignable.

```c++
class PolymorphicInterface {
  protected:
    PolymorphicInterface(const PolymorphicInterface&) = default;
    ~PolymorphicInterface() = default;
  public:
   // virtual functions
};
```

For an interface type with a public virtual destructor, users would potentially
pay the cost of virtual dispatch twice when deleting `polymorphic<I>` objects
containing derived-type objects.

All derived types owned by a `polymorphic` must be publicly copy constructible.

## Prior work

This proposal continues the work started in [P0201] and [P1950].

Previous work on a cloned pointer type [N3339] met with opposition because of
the mixing of value and pointer semantics. We believe that the unambiguous value
semantics of `indirect` and `polymorphic` as described in this proposal address
these concerns.

## Impact on the standard

This proposal is a pure library extension. It requires additions to be made to
the standard library header `<memory>`.

### X.Y Class template indirect [indirect]

#### X.Y.1 Class template indirect general [indirect.general]

1. An indirect object manages the lifetime of an owned object. An indirect
object is _valueless_ if it has no owned object. An indirect object may only
become valueless after it has been moved from.

2. In every specialization `indirect<T, Allocator>`, if the type
`allocator_traits<Allocator>::value_type` is not the same type as `T`, the
program is ill-formed. Every object of type `indirect<T, Allocator>` uses an
object of type `Allocator` to allocate and free storage for the owned object as
needed.

3. Constructing an owned object with arguments `args...` using an allocator `a`
means calling `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::construct(a, p, args...)` where
`p` is a pointer obtained by calling
`allocator_traits<allocator_type>::allocate`.

4. Copy constructors for an indirect value obtain an allocator by calling
`allocator_traits<allocator_type>::select_on_container_copy_construction` on the
allocator belonging to the indirect value being copied. Move constructors obtain
an allocator by move construction from the allocator belonging to the object
being moved. All other constructors for these types take a `const
allocator_type& argument`. _[Note 3: If an invocation of a constructor uses the
default value of an optional allocator argument, then the allocator type must
support value-initialization. --end note]_ A copy of this allocator is used for
any memory allocation and element construction performed by these constructors
and by all member functions during the lifetime of each indirect value object,
or until the allocator is replaced. The allocator may be replaced only via
assignment or `swap()`. Allocator replacement is performed by copy assignment,
move assignment, or swapping of the allocator only if

    (3.1)
    `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_copy_assignment::value`,

    (3.2)
    `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_move_assignment::value`,

    (3.3) `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_swap::value`

    is `true` within the implementation of the corresponding indirect value
    operation.

4. A program that instantiates the definition of indirect for a non-object type,
   an array type, `in_place_t`, or a cv-qualified type is ill-formed.

6. The template parameter `T` of `indirect` may be an incomplete type.

7. The template parameter `Allocator` of `indirect` shall meet the
   _Cpp17Allocator_ requirements.

8. If a program declares an explicit or partial specialization of `indirect`,
   the behavior is undefined.

  `is_copy_constructible_v<T>` is `true`.

15. _Mandates_: `T` is a complete type.

16. _Effects_: `alloc` is direct-non-list-initialized with `a`. Constructs an

    allocator `alloc`.

17. _Postconditions_: `*this` is not valueless.

```c++

```

19. _Mandates_: `T` is a complete type.

20. _Effects_: `alloc` is direct-non-list-initialized with `a`. If `other` is

#### X.Y.4 Destructor [indirect.dtor]

```c++
constexpr ~indirect();
```

1. _Mandates_: `T` is a complete type.

2. _Effects_: If `*this` is not valueless, destroys the owned object using
  `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::destroy` and then the storage is
  deallocated.

#### X.Y.5 Assignment [indirect.assign]

```c++
constexpr indirect& operator=(const indirect& other);
```

1. _Mandates_: `T` is a complete type.

2. _Effects_: If `other == *this` then no effect.

  If `allocator_traits<Alloc>::propagate_on_container_copy_assignment` is
  `true` and `alloc != other.alloc` then the allocator needs updating.

  If `other` is valueless, `*this` becomes valueless and the owned object in
  `*this`, if any, is destroyed using `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::destroy`
  and then the storage is deallocated.

  Otherwise, if `alloc == other.alloc` and `this` is not valueless, the owned
  object is assigned to `*other`.

  Otherwise a new owned object is constructed in `*this` using
  `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::construct` with the owned object from
  `other` as the argument, using either the allocator in `*this` or the
  allocator in `other` if the allocator needs updating. The previously owned
  object in `*this`, if any, is destroyed using
  `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::destroy` and then the storage is
  deallocated.

  If the allocator needs updating, the allocator in `this` is replaced with a
  copy of the allocator in `other`.

3. _Returns_: A reference to `*this`.

4. _Remarks_: If any exception is thrown, the result of the expression
   `this->valueless_after_move()` remains unchanged. If an exception is thrown
   during the call to `T`'s selected copy constructor, no effect. If an
   exception is thrown during the call to `T`'s copy assignment, the state of
   its contained value is as defined by the exception safety guarantee of `T`'s
   copy assignment.

```c++
constexpr indirect& operator=(indirect&& other) noexcept(
    allocator_traits<Allocator>::propagate_on_container_move_assignment::value ||
    allocator_traits<Allocator>::is_always_equal::value);
```

5. _Effects_: If
  `allocator_traits<Alloc>::propagate_on_container_move_assignment` is
  `true` and `alloc != other.alloc` then the allocator needs updating.

  If `other` is valueless, `*this` becomes valueless and the owned object in
  `*this`, if any, is destroyed using `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::destroy`
  and then the storage is deallocated.

  Otherwise, if `alloc == other.alloc`, swaps the owned objects in `*this` and
  `other`; the owned object in `other`, if any, is then destroyed using
  `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::destroy` and then the storage is deallocated.

  Otherwise a new owned object is constructed in `*this` using
  `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::construct` with the owned object from
  `other` as the argument as an rvalue, using either the allocator in `*this` or
  the allocator in `other` if the allocator needs updating. The previous owned
  object in `*this`, if any, is destroyed using
  `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::destroy` and then the storage is
  deallocated. If the allocator needs updating, the allocator in `*this` is
  replaced with a copy of the allocator in `other`.

6. _Postconditions_: `other` is valueless.

7. _Returns_: A reference to `*this`.

8. _Remarks_: If any exception is thrown, the results of the expressions
   `this->valueless_after_move()` and `other.valueless_after_move()` remain
   unchanged. If an exception is thrown during the call to `T`'s selected move
   constructor, no effect.

9. _[Note: The use of this function may require that `T` be a complete type
   dependent on behavior of the allocator. — end note]_

#### X.Y.6 Observers [indirect.observers]

```

1. _Preconditions_: `*this` is not valueless.

2. _Returns_: `*p`.

3. [Note: The use of these functions typically requires that `T` be a complete
   type. —end note]

```c++
constexpr const T&& operator*() const && noexcept;
constexpr T&& operator*() && noexcept;
```

4. _Preconditions_: `*this` is not valueless.

8. _Returns_: `p`.

9. [Note: The use of these functions typically requires that `T` be a complete
   type. —end note]

```c++
constexpr bool valueless_after_move() const noexcept;
```

10. _Returns_: `true` if `*this` is valueless, otherwise `false`.

```c++
constexpr allocator_type get_allocator() const noexcept;

```c++
constexpr void swap(indirect& other) noexcept(
  allocator_traits::propagate_on_container_swap::value
  || allocator_traits<Allocator>::is_always_equal::value);
```

1. _Effects_: Swaps the states of `*this` and `other`, exchanging owned objects
  or valueless states. If
  `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_swap::value` is
  `true`, then `allocator_type` shall meet the _Cpp17Swappable_ requirements and
  the allocators of `*this` and `other` are exchanged by calling `swap` as
  described in [swappable.requirements]. Otherwise, the allocators are not
  swapped, and the behavior is undefined unless `(*this).get_allocator() ==
  other.get_allocator()`. _[Note: Does not call `swap` on the owned objects
  directly. --end note]_

2. _[Note 2: The use of this function may require that `T` be a complete type
dependent on behavior of the allocator. — end note]_

3. _[Note 3: Exception guarantees for `swap` are intended to model the behavior
of exception guarantees for `std::vector::swap`. — end note]_

```c++
constexpr void swap(indirect& lhs, indirect& rhs) noexcept(
  noexcept(lhs.swap(rhs)));
```

3. _Effects_: Equivalent to `lhs.swap(rhs)`.

#### X.Y.8 Relational operators [indirect.relops]

```c++
template <class U, class AA>
constexpr bool operator==(const indirect& lhs, const indirect<U, AA>& rhs)
  noexcept(noexcept(*lhs == *rhs));
```

1. _Constraints_: `*lhs == *rhs` is well-formed.

2. _Returns_: If `lhs` is valueless or `rhs` is valueless,
  `lhs.valueless_after_move()==rhs.valueless_after_move()`; otherwise `*lhs ==
  *rhs`.

3. _Remarks_: Specializations of this function template for which `*lhs == *rhs`
  is a core constant expression are constexpr functions.

```c++
template <class U, class AA>
constexpr auto operator<=>(const indirect& lhs, const indirect<U, AA>& rhs)
  noexcept(noexcept(*lhs <=> *rhs)) -> compare_three_way_result_t<T, U>;
```

4. _Constraints_: `*lhs <=> *rhs` is well-formed.

5. _Returns_: If `lhs` is valueless or `rhs` is valueless,
  `!lhs.valueless_after_move() <=> !rhs.valueless_after_move()`; otherwise `*lhs
  <=> *rhs`.

6. _Remarks_: Specializations of this function template for which `*lhs <=>
  *rhs` is a core constant expression are constexpr functions.

#### X.Y.9 Comparison with T [indirect.comp.with.t]

```c++
template <class U>
constexpr bool operator==(const indirect& lhs, const U& rhs)
  noexcept(noexcept(*lhs == rhs));
```

1. _Constraints_: `*lhs == rhs` is well-formed.

2. _Returns_: If `lhs` is valueless, false; otherwise `*lhs == rhs`.

3. _Remarks_: Specializations of this function template for which `*lhs == rhs`
   is a core constant expression, are constexpr functions.

```c++
template <class U>
constexpr auto operator<=>(const indirect& lhs, const U& rhs)
  noexcept(noexcept(*lhs <=> rhs)) -> compare_three_way_result_t<T, U>;
```

4. _Constraints_: `*lhs <=> rhs` is well-formed.

5. _Returns_: If `rhs` is valueless, `false <=> true`; otherwise `*lhs <=> rhs`.

6. _Remarks_: Specializations of this function template for which `*lhs <=> rhs`
   is a core constant expression, are constexpr functions.


#### X.Y.10 Hash support [indirect.hash]

```c++
template <class T, class Alloc>
struct hash<indirect<T, Alloc>>;
```

1. The specialization `hash<indirect<T, Alloc>>` is enabled ([unord.hash]) if
and only if `hash<remove_const_t<T>>` is enabled. When enabled for an object `i`
of type `indirect<T, Alloc>`, then `hash<indirect<T, Alloc>>()(i)` evaluates to
either the same value as `hash<remove_const_t<T>>()(*i)`, if `i` is not
valueless; otherwise to an implementation-defined value. The member functions
are not guaranteed to be noexcept.

### X.Z Class template polymorphic [polymorphic]

#### X.Z.1 Class template polymorphic general [polymorphic.general]

1. A polymorphic object manages the lifetime of an owned object. A polymorphic
object may own objects of different types at different points in its lifetime. A
polymorphic object is _valueless_ if it has no owned object. A polymorphic
object may only become valueless after it has been moved from.

2. In every specialization `polymorphic<T, Allocator>`, if the type
`allocator_traits<Allocator>::value_type` is not the same type as`T`, the
program is ill-formed. Every object of type `polymorphic<T, Allocator>` uses an
object of type `Allocator` to allocate and free storage for the owned object as
needed.

3. Constructing an owned object with arguments `args...` using an allocator `a`
means calling `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::rebind_traits<U>::construct(a,
p, args...)` where `p` is a pointer obtained by calling
`allocator_traits<allocator_type>::rebind_traits<U>::allocate` and `U` is either
`allocator_type::value_type` or an internal type used by the polymorphic value.

4. Copy constructors for a polymorphic value obtain an allocator by calling
`allocator_traits<allocator_type>::select_on_container_copy_construction` on the
allocator belonging to the polymorphic value being copied. Move constructors
obtain an allocator by move construction from the allocator belonging to the
object being moved. All other constructors for these types take a `const
allocator_type& argument`. [Note 3: If an invocation of a constructor uses the
default value of an optional allocator argument, then the allocator type must
support value-initialization.  end note] A copy of this allocator is used for
any memory allocation and element construction performed by these constructors
and by all member functions during the lifetime of each polymorphic value
object, or until the allocator is replaced. The allocator may be replaced only
via assignment or `swap()`. Allocator replacement is performed by copy
assignment, move assignment, or swapping of the allocator only if (64.1)
`allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_copy_assignment::value`,
(64.2)
`allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_move_assignment::value`,
or (64.3) `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_swap::value`
is true within the implementation of the corresponding polymorphic value
operation.

5. A program that instantiates the definition of polymorphic for a non-object
   type, an array type, a specialization of `in_place_type_t` or a cv-qualified
   type is ill-formed.

6. The template parameter `T` of `polymorphic` may be an incomplete type.

7. The template parameter `Allocator` of `polymorphic` shall meet the
   requirements of _Cpp17Allocator_.

8. If a program declares an explicit or partial specialization of `polymorphic`,
   the behavior is undefined.

  Ts...>` is `true`. `is_copy_constructible_v<U>` is `true`.
  `is_default_constructible_v<allocator_type>` is `true`.

11. _Mandates_: `T` is a complete type.

12. _Effects_: Equivalent to `polymorphic(allocator_arg_t{}, Allocator(),
    in_place_type_t<U>{}, std::forward<Ts>(ts)...)`.

```c++
template <class U, class... Ts>
explicit constexpr polymorphic(allocator_arg_t, const Allocator& a,
                      in_place_type_t<U>, Ts&&... ts);
```

13. _Constraints_: `is_base_of_v<T, U>` is `true` and `is_constructible_v<U,
  Ts...>` is `true` and `is_copy_constructible_v<U>` is `true`.

14. _Mandates_: `T` is a complete type.

15. _Effects_: `alloc` is direct-non-list-initialized with `a`. Constructs an
    owned object of type `U` with `std​::​forward<Ts>(ts)...` using the
    allocator `alloc`.

16. _Postconditions_: `*this` is not valueless.  The owned instance targets an
  object of type `U` constructed  with `std::forward<Ts>(ts)...`.

```c++
constexpr polymorphic(const polymorphic& other);
```

17. _Effects_: Equivalent to `polymorphic(allocator_arg_t{},

  other)`.

```c++

```

18. _Mandates_: `T` is a complete type.

19. _Effects_: `alloc` is direct-non-list-initialized with `alloc`. If `other`
    is valueless, `*this` is valueless. Otherwise, constructs an owned object of

    an rvalue. Otherwise, if `alloc != other.alloc`, constructs an object of type
    `polymorphic`, considering that owned object as an rvalue, using the
    allocator `alloc`.

  _[Drafting note: The above is intended to permit a small-buffer-optimization
  and handle the case where allocators compare equal but we do not want to swap
  pointers.]_

```

1. _Mandates_: `T` is a complete type.

2. _Effects_: If `*this` is not valueless, destroys the owned object using

  `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::rebind_traits::construct` with the owned
  object from `other` as the argument, using either the allocator in `*this` or
  the allocator in `other` if the allocator needs updating.

  The previous owned object in `*this`, if any, is destroyed using

  If the allocator needs updating, the allocator in `this` is replaced with a
  copy of the allocator in `other`.

3. _Returns_: A reference to `*this`.

4. _Remarks_: If any exception is thrown, the results of the expression
   `this->valueless_after_move()` remains unchanged. If an exception is thrown
   during the call to the owned object's selected copy constructor, no effect.

```c++
constexpr polymorphic& operator=(polymorphic&& other) noexcept(
    allocator_traits<Allocator>::propagate_on_container_move_assignment::value ||

```

5. _Effects_: If `other == *this` then no effect.

  `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::rebind_traits::destroy` and then the
  storage is deallocated.

  Otherwise, if `alloc != other.alloc`; if `other` is not valueless, a new owned
  object is constructed in `*this` using
  `allocator_traits<allocator_type>::rebind_traits::construct` with the owned
  object from `other` as the argument as an rvalue, using either the allocator

7. _Remarks_: If any exception is thrown, the results of the expressions
   `this->valueless_after_move()` and `other.valueless_after_move()` remain

   selected move constructor, no effect.

1. _Effects_: Swaps the states of `*this` and `other`, exchanging owned objects

## Appendix A: Detailed design decisions

We discuss some of the decisions that were made in the design of `indirect` and
`polymorphic`. Where there are multiple options, we discuss the advantages and
disadvantages of each.

### Two class templates, not one

It is conceivable that a single class template could be used as a vocabulary
type for an indirect value type supporting polymorphism. However, implementing
this would impose efficiency costs on the copy constructor when the owned object
is the same type as the template type. When the owned object is a derived type,
the copy constructor uses type erasure to perform dynamic dispatch and call the
derived type copy constructor. The overhead of indirection and a virtual
function call is not tolerable where the owned object type and template type
match.

One potential solution would be to use a `std::variant` to store the owned type
or the control block used to manage the owned type. This would allow the copy
constructor to be implemented efficiently when the owned type and template type
match. This would increase the object size beyond that of a single pointer as
the discriminant must be stored.

For the sake of minimal size and efficiency, we opted to use two class
templates.

### Copiers, deleters, pointer constructors, and allocator support

The older types `indirect_value` and `polymorphic_value` had constructors that
take a pointer, copier, and deleter. The copier and deleter could be used to
specify how the object should be copied and deleted. The existence of a pointer
constructor introduces undesirable properties into the design of
`polymorphic_value`, such as allowing the possibility of object slicing on copy
when the dynamic and static types of a derived-type pointer do not match.

We decided to remove the copier, delete, and pointer constructor in favour of
adding allocator support. A pointer constructor and support for custom copiers
and deleters are not core to the design of either class template; both could be
added in a later revision of the standard if required.

We have been advised that allocator support must be a part of the initial
implementation and cannot be added retrospectively. As `indirect` and
`polymorphic` are intended to be used alongside other C++ standard library
types, such as `std::map` and `std::vector`, it is important that they have
allocator support in contexts where allocators are used.

### Pointer-like helper functions

Earlier revisions of `polymorphic_value` had helper functions to get access to
the underlying pointer. These were removed under the advice of the Library
Evolution Working Group as they were not core to the design of the class
template, nor were they consistent with value-type semantics.

Pointer-like accessors like `dynamic_pointer_cast` and `static_pointer_cast`,
which are provided for `std::shared_ptr`, could be added in a later revision of
the standard if required.

### Constraints on incomplete types and conditional constructors

Both `indirect` and `polymorphic` support incomplete types. Support for an
incomplete type requires deferring the instantiation of functions with
requirements until they are used.

The default constructor of `indirect` requires that `T` is default
constructible. We cannot write this constraint as a requirement on `T` because
that would require `T` to be a complete type at class instantiation time.
Instead we write the constraint as a requirement on a deduced type `TT` to defer
evaluation of the constraint until the default constructor is instantiated.

```c++
template <typename TT = T>
indirect() requires is_default_constructible_v<TT>;
```

We can use this technique to write constraints on the default constructor of
`indirect` and `polymorphic`. Both `indirect` and `polymorphic` are
conditionally default constructible.

The same technique cannot be used for the copy or move constructor of
`polymorphic` because that would require type information on an open set of
erased types, which is not possible: a `polymorphic` object can contain any type
that is derived from `T`, we cannot write a constraint that requires that all
such types are copy constructible. We make `polymorphic` unconditionally copy
and move constructible. The authors do not envisage that this could be relaxed
in a future version of the C++ standard.

While a copy constructor cannot be a template, in C++20 and later we can
conditionally constrain copy construction of `indirect` by defining:

```c++
indirect(const indirect& other) requires false = delete;

template <typename TT = T>
indirect(const indirect& other) requires is_copy_constructible_v<TT>;
```

An instantiation of the function template with `TT=T` is added to the overload
set when `indirect` is copy-constructed and will be selected if the owned object
type `T` is copy constructible. This would make copy construction conditional
for `indirect` but not for `polymorphic`. We opt for consistency and make copy
construction unconditional for both `indirect` and `polymorphic`. Making
`indirect` conditionally copy constructible in a future version of the C++
standard would require adding a template function as above and would be an ABI
break. It might be simpler to add new types for non-copyable `indirect` and
`polymorphic` objects, although we do not propose the addition of such types in
this draft.

### Implicit conversions

We decided that there should be no implicit conversion of a value `T` to an
`indirect<T>` or `polymorphic<T>`. An implicit conversion would require using
the free store and memory allocation, which is best made explicit by the user.

```c++
Rectangle r(w, h);
polymorphic<Shape> s = r; // error
```

To transform a value into `indirect` or `polymorphic`, the user must use the
appropriate constructor.

```c++
Rectangle r(w, h);
polymorphic<Shape> s(std::in_place_type<Rectangle>, r);
assert(dynamic_cast<Rectangle*>(&*s) != nullptr);
```

### Explicit conversions

The older class template `polymorphic_value` had explicit conversions, allowing
construction of a `polymorphic_value<T>` from a `polymorphic_value<U>`, where
`T` was a base class of `U`.

```c++
polymorphic_value<Quadrilateral> q(std::in_place_type<Rectangle>, w, h);
polymorphic_value<Shape> s = q;
assert(dynamic_cast<Rectangle*>(&*s) != nullptr);
```

Similar code cannot be written with `polymorphic` as it does not allow
conversions between derived types:

```c++
polymorphic<Quadrilateral> q(std::in_place_type<Rectangle>, w, h);
polymorphic<Shape> s = q; // error
```

This is a deliberate design decision. `polymorphic` is intended to be used for
ownership of member data in composite classes where compiler-generated special
member functions will be used.

There is no motivating use case for explicit conversion between derived types
outside of tests.

A converting constructor could be added in a future version of the C++ standard.

### Comparisons for `indirect`

We implement comparisons for `indirect` in terms of `operator==` and
`operator<=>` returning `bool` and `auto` respectively.

The alternative would be to implement the full suite of comparison operators,
forwarding them to the underlying type and allowing non-boolean return types.
Support for non-boolean return types would support unusual (non-regular)
user-defined comparison operators which could be helpful when the underlying
type is part of a domain-specific-language (DSL) that uses comparison operators
for a different purpose. However, this would be inconsistent with other standard
library types like `optional`, `variant` and `reference_wrapper`. Moreover, we'd
likely only give partial support for a theoretical DSL which may well make use
of other operators like `operator+` and `operator-` which are not supported for
`indirect`.

### Supporting `operator()` `operator[]`

There is no need for `indirect` or `polymorphic` to provide a function call or
an indexing operator. Users who wish to do that can simply access the value and
call its operator. Furthermore, unlike comparisons, function calls or indexing
operators do not compose further; for example, a composite would not be able to
automatically generate a composited `operator()` or an `operator[]`.

### Supporting arithmetic operators

While we could provide support for arithmetic operators, `+`, `-` ,`*`, `/`, to
`indirect` in the same way that we support comparisons, we have chosen not to do
so. The arithmetic operators would need to support a valueless state which there
is no precedent for in the standard library.

Support for arithmetic operators could be added in a future version of the C++
standard. If support for arithmetic operators for valueless or empty objects is
later added to the standard library in a coherent way, it could be added for
`indirect` at that time.

### Member function `emplace`

Neither `indirect` nor `polymorphic` support `emplace` as a member function. The
member function `emplace` could be added as :

```c++
template <typename ...Ts>
indirect::emplace(Ts&& ...ts);
```

```c++
template <typename U, typename ...Ts>
polymorphic::emplace(in_place_type<U>, Ts&& ...ts);
```

This would be API noise. It offers no efficiency improvement over:

```c++
some_indirect = indirect(/* arguments */);
```

```c++
some_polymorphic = polymorphic(in_place_type<U>, /* arguments */);
```

Support for an emplace member function could be added in a future version of the
C++ standard.

### Small Buffer Optimisation

It is possible to implement `polymorphic` with a small buffer optimisation,
similar to that used in `std::function`. This would allow `polymorphic` to store
small objects without allocating memory. Like `std::function`, the size of the
small buffer is left to be specified by the implementation.

The authors are sceptical of the value of a small buffer optimisation for
objects from a type hierarchy. If the buffer is too small, all instances of
`polymorphic` will be larger than needed. This is because they will allocate
heap in addition to having the memory from the (empty) buffer as part of the
object size. If the buffer is too big, `polymorphic` objects will be larger than
necessary, potentially introducing the need for `indirect<polymorphic<T>>`.

We could add a non-type template argument to `polymorphic` to specify the size
of the small buffer:

```c++
template <typename T, typename Alloc, size_t BufferSize>
class polymorphic;
```

However, we opt not to do this to maintain consistency with other standard
library types. Both `std::function` and `std::string` leave the buffer size as
an implementation detail. Including an additional template argument in a later
revision of the standard would be a breaking change. With usage experience,
implementers will be able to determine if a small buffer optimisation is
worthwhile, and what the optimal buffer size might be.

A small buffer optimisation makes little sense for `indirect` as the sensible
size of the buffer would be dictated by the size of the stored object. This
removes support for incomplete types and locates storage for the object locally,
defeating the purpose of `indirect`.

## Appendix B: Before and after examples

We include some minimal, illustrative examples of how `indirect` and
`polymorphic` can be used to simplify composite class design.

### Using `indirect` for binary compatibility using the PIMPL idiom

Without `indirect`, we use `std::unique_ptr` to manage the lifetime of the
implementation object. All const-qualified methods of the composite will need to
be manually checked to ensure that they are not calling non-const qualified
methods of component objects.

#### Before, without using `indirect`

```c++
// Class.h

class Class {
  class Impl;
  std::unique_ptr<Impl> impl_;
 public:
  Class();
  ~Class();
  Class(const Class&);
  Class& operator=(const Class&);
  Class(Class&&) noexcept;
  Class& operator=(Class&&) noexcept;

  void do_something();
};
```

```c++
// Class.cpp

class Impl {
 public:
  void do_something();
};

Class::Class() : impl_(std::make_unique<Impl>()) {}

Class::~Class() = default;

Class::Class(const Class& other) : impl_(std::make_unique<Impl>(*other.impl_)) {}

Class& Class::operator=(const Class& other) {
  if (this != &other) {
    Class tmp(other);
    using std::swap;
    swap(*this, tmp);
  }
  return *this;
}

Class(Class&&) noexcept = default;
Class& operator=(Class&&) noexcept = default;

void Class::do_something() {
  impl_->do_something();
}
```

#### After, using `indirect`

```c++
// Class.h

class Class {
  indirect<class Impl> impl_;
 public:
  Class();
  ~Class();
  Class(const Class&);
  Class& operator=(const Class&);
  Class(Class&&) noexcept;
  Class& operator=(Class&&) noexcept;

  void do_something();
};
```

```c++
// Class.cpp

class Impl {
 public:
  void do_something();
};

Class::Class() : impl_(indirect<Impl>()) {}
Class::~Class() = default;
Class::Class(const Class&) = default;
Class& Class::operator=(const Class&) = default;
Class(Class&&) noexcept = default;
Class& operator=(Class&&) noexcept = default;

void Class::do_something() {
  impl_->do_something();
}
```

### Using `polymorphic` for a composite class

Without `polymorphic`, we use `std::unique_ptr` to manage the lifetime of
component objects. All const-qualified methods of the composite will need to be
manually checked to ensure that they are not calling non-const qualified methods
of component objects.

#### Before, without using `polymorphic`

```c++
class Canvas;

class Shape {
 public:
  virtual ~Shape() = default;
  virtual std::unique_ptr<Shape> clone() = 0;
  virtual void draw(Canvas&) const = 0;
};

class Picture {
  std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Shape>> shapes_;

 public:
  Picture(const std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Shape>>& shapes) {
    shapes_.reserve(shapes.size());
    for (auto& shape : shapes) {
      shapes_.push_back(shape->clone());
    }
  }

  Picture(const Picture& other) {
    shapes_.reserve(other.shapes_.size());
    for (auto& shape : other.shapes_) {
      shapes_.push_back(shape->clone());
    }
  }

  Picture& operator=(const Picture& other) {
    if (this != &other) {
      Picture tmp(other);
      using std::swap;
      swap(*this, tmp);
    }
    return *this;
  }

  void draw(Canvas& canvas) const;
};

```

#### After, using `polymorphic`

```c++
class Canvas;

class Shape {
 protected:
  ~Shape() = default;

 public:
  virtual void draw(Canvas&) const = 0;
};

class Picture {
  std::vector<polymorphic<Shape>> shapes_;

 public:
  Picture(const std::vector<polymorphic<Shape>>& shapes)
      : shapes_(shapes) {}

  // Picture(const Picture& other) = default;

  // Picture& operator=(const Picture& other) = default;

  void draw(Canvas& canvas) const;
};
```

## Appendix C: Design choices, alternatives and breaking changes

The table below shows the main design components considered, the design
decisions made, and the cost and impact of alternative design choices. As
presented in this paper, the design of class templates `indirect` and
`polymorphic` has been approved by the LEWG. The authors have until C++26 is
standardized to consider making any breaking changes; after C++26, whilst
breaking changes will still be possible, the impact of these changes on users
could be potentially significant and unwelcome.
