# Here be dragons: Dockerfile and mpark's markdown files

This directory contains a minimally-tested Dockerfile for processing markdown files
using mpark's markdown library <https://github.com/mpark/wg21.git>.

We've tested that it works for our narrow use case only.

For internal use only. Do not use in GitHub Actions or other CI/CD pipelines.
